The classic Tetris game, but using a Raspberry Pi and an 8x8 LED matrix (yes this is hard mode)!

To play, you use the on-board joystick on the RPi SenseHat shield to rotate, shift, and accelerate pieces.

You can also tilt the RPi to shift pieces/accelerate downwards. 

Once you lose, the score will be displayed. To play again, press the joy stick.

Materials:
1x Raspberry Pi 3+
1x SenseHAT
